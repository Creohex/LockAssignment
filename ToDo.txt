    Wire up SS cooldown sharing via comms - done
    Redefine the MVP -
        Addon needs to get all the warlocks in the raid and display them in the UI.
        The addon then needs to update in "real time" when someone modifies an assignment.
        The addon should display soul stone cooldowns in near real time.
        The addon should have an is dirty detection to see if user has made changes.
    -DONE DONE DONE
    Add a commit button for if data is to be saved. - done
    Need to apply the data changes submitted through the messaging channel and make some decisions on the distibuted ledger of it all. - done
        -This was accomplished by using timestamps, the newest data gets loaded over the old data.
    possible issue - Not sure what happens in raid mode if a player leaves / moves in the raid. The SS target info may become corrupt. - DONE
        This issue is confirmed, and needs to be addressed prior to the original release of the addon.
    Set Default assignment to "None" if the assigned value is no longer selectable. - done
    Need to fix the cancel button to undo changes. - done
    Move all print statements into a debug mode. - done

    Resolve a race condition that removes all warlocks from the screen.
    

ToDo:
    Assignment confirmation
        Ask for confirmation - this will require a confirmation frame to be added.
            User has updated the UI and has requested confirmation from all other users.
            the addon will broadcast to the users to accept the assignments
            when they click yes or no then the addon will reply with confirmation result.

    Add a notification system the will show messages when action is needed I.E - SS needed, Curse Needed, Banish wearing off--

    Need to add raid validation to show a message when user is not in a raid

    Need to add macro for curse button.

    May add a solo mode for curse button.

    Need to add event subscription to update the ui if the raid state changes. (only if the addon is showing.)

    Issue - If a raider leaves and the assignments are taken away then portaits can be sticky. Not sure if this will affect it in raid mode.

    Issue - Spell texture does not render on non-warlock characters.

    There appears to be some kind of timestamp issue involving saving changes as well as soulstone cooldowns.
        There an issue on receiving SS CDs.
        Ok, the issue is that GetTime() is broken for what I am trying to use it for, it worked local but that is because it is based on a local machine timestamp.
