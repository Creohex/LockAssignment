This serves as a living task list document for Never Locky

Features:
    Create a main housing frame that is capable of being shown and hidden using a button or console command - done 
    Add a nice label to the top of that frame to display the name of the addon. - done
    Build a scroll bar that is capable of scrolling up and down - done
    Build a Modular Frame template that can be used to house the information for each member of the raid. - Failed
        The XML used for this got very complex very quickly, decided to look for other alternatives.
    Scrap the scroll bar in favor of building one from scratch using the widget API. - done
    Build a Modular frame that can be used to house the raid member's information - done
    Add a nameplate to the Modular frame template - done
    Add a portrait to the Modular frame template - done
    Add a curse asssignment control to the template - done
    Add a curse graphic that updates in real time based on the selection choice - done
    Add a banish contrl to the template - done
    Add a banish target graphic that behaves like the curse graphic - done
    Add a soul stone target selector that is fed by the members in the raid - done
    Decouple the data from the frames by creating a warlock table object that can be used to drive the ui as a datamodel - done
    Add the ability to get a particular frame by id - done
    Add the ability to update a frame using a warlock table object - done
    Increase the capacity of the locky friend frames to 40 - done

ToDo:
    Add a soul stone tracker.
        - This can be done using the get item cooldown api call
        - I think I can store the time that the CD began and then use LUA to math out the rest.
        - This will allow everyone to stay in sync in seeing each other's CDs.
    
    Add the ability to communicate with other NeverLocky addons in the raid.
        - I am currently looking at setting this up as a channel using Ace3 comms.
        - More research is needed to figure this out.
    
    Add an update all function to implement one-way binding from the warlock collection to the UI.
        - This is mostly low hanging fruit.

    Add a Test function to simulate adding and removing players from the raid.

    Rework how the locky friend frames are identified to prevent possible collision with other addons.
