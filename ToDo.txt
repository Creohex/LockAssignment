    Build a scroll bar that is capable of scrolling up and down - done
    Build a Modular Frame template that can be used to house the information for each member of the raid. - Failed
        The XML used for this got very complex very quickly, decided to look for other alternatives.
    Scrap the scroll bar in favor of building one from scratch using the widget API. - done

    Decouple the data from the frames by creating a warlock table object that can be used to drive the ui as a datamodel - done

    Add the ability to update a frame using a warlock table object - done
    Increase the capacity of the locky friend frames to 40 - done
    Rework how the locky friend frames are identified to prevent possible collision with other addons.- done
    Add an update all function to implement one-way binding from the warlock collection to the UI. - done
    Add a Test function to simulate adding and removing players from the raid. - done
    Need to add default assignments inside of a function - done

ToDo:
    Add a soul stone tracker.
        - This can be done using the get item cooldown api call
        - I think I can store the time that the CD began and then use LUA to math out the rest.
        - This will allow everyone to stay in sync in seeing each other's CDs.
    
    Add the ability to communicate with other NeverLocky addons in the raid.
        - I am currently looking at setting this up as a channel using Ace3 comms.
        - More research is needed to figure this out.

    Need to add raid validation to show a message when user is not in a raid

    Need to add macro for curse button.

    May add a solo mode for curse button.

    Need to add event subscription to update the ui if the raid state changes. (only if the addon is showing.)

    Issue - If a raider leaves and the assignments are taken away then portaits can be sticky. Not sure if this will affect it in raid mode.

    Issue - Spell texture does not render on non-warlock characters.
