# LockAssignment
UI addon for vanila WoW (1.12) to allow users to assign curses, banish responsibilities, and soul stone recipients for 40 man raids.
This is a modified version of [NeverLocky](https://github.com/JohnImboden/NeverLocky) that was ported to WoW 1.12 with additional features and changes.
